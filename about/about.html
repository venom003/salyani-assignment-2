    <h2>Colonial period</h2>
    <p>The Mughals introduced Persian literature and high culture, establishing the roots of Indo-Persian culture in the
        region. From the region of modern-day Pakistan, key cities during the Mughal rule were Lahore and Thatta, both of
        which were chosen as the site of impressive Mughal buildings. In the early 16th century, the region remained under
        the Mughal Empire ruled by Muslim emperors. By the early 18th century, increasing European influence contributed to
        the slow disintegration of the Mughal Empire as the lines between commercial and political dominance became
        increasingly blurred. During this time, the English East India Company had established coastal outposts. Control
        over the seas, greater resources, technology, and British military protection led the Company to increasingly flex
        its military muscle, allowing the Company to gain control over the subcontinent by 1765 and sideline European
        competitors. Expanding access beyond Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to
        annex or subdue most of region by the 1820s. Many historians see this as the start of the region's colonial period.
        By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an
        arm of British administration, the Company began more deliberately to enter non-economic arenas such as education,
        social reform, and culture. Such reforms included the enforcement of the English Education Act in 1835 and the
        introduction of the Indian Civil Service (ICS). Traditional madrasahs—primary institutions of higher learning for
        Muslims in the subcontinent—were no longer supported by the English Crown, and nearly all of the madrasahs lost
        their financial endowment.</p>
    <h2>Pakistan Movement</h2>
    <p>However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments for a united Islamic bloc called Islamistan were not shared by other
        Muslim governments, although Islamists such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of
        the Muslim Brotherhood, became drawn to the country. Pakistan's desire for an international organization of Muslim
        countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) was formed. The strongest
        opposition to the Islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the Bengali Muslims of East
        Pakistan whose educated class, according to a survey by social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed, preferred secularism and
        focused on ethnic identity unlike educated West Pakistanis who tended to prefer an Islamic identity.[169] The
        Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami considered Pakistan to be an Islamic state and believed Bengali nationalism to be
        unacceptable. In the 1971 conflict over East Pakistan, the Jamaat-e-Islami fought the Bengali nationalists on the
        Pakistan Army's side.</p>
