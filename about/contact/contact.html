<h2>History</h2>
<p>The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was the site of several ancient cultures and intertwined with the history
    of the broader Indian subcontinent. The ancient history involves the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age
    Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures,
    including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous
    empires and dynasties, including the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander III of Macedon's empire, the Seleucid
    Empire, the Indian Maurya Empire, the Kushan Empire, the Gupta Empire, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Ghaznavids
    Empire, the Ghurid Sultanate, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Sur Empire, the Afghan
    Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire (partially) and, most recently, the British Indian Empire.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The Arab conqueror Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh in 711 CE. The Pakistan government's official chronology claims
    this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid but the concept of Pakistan came in 19th century. The
    Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region. During this period, Sufi
    missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to Islam.
    These developments set the stage for the rule of several successive Muslim empires in the region, including the
    Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE). The Lodi dynasty, the
    last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE).</p>
