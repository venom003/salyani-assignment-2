    <h2>About Pakistan</h2>
    <p>Pakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a country in South Asia. It is the world's fifth-most
        populous country with a population exceeding 212.2 million. It has the world's second-largest Muslim population. It
        is the 33rd-largest country by area, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). Pakistan has a
        1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to
        the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is separated narrowly from
        Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the northwest, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was the site of several ancient cultures and intertwined with the history
        of the broader Indian subcontinent. The ancient history involves the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age
        Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures,
        including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous
        empires and dynasties, including the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander III of Macedon's empire, the Seleucid
        Empire, the Indian Maurya Empire, the Kushan Empire, the Gupta Empire, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Ghaznavids
        Empire, the Ghurid Sultanate, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Sur Empire, the Afghan
        Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire (partially) and, most recently, the British Indian Empire.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The Arab conqueror Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh in 711 CE. The Pakistan government's official chronology claims
        this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid but the concept of Pakistan came in 19th century. The
        Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region. During this period, Sufi
        missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to Islam.
        These developments set the stage for the rule of several successive Muslim empires in the region, including the
        Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE). The Lodi dynasty, the
        last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE).</p>
    <h2>Colonial period</h2>
    <p>The Mughals introduced Persian literature and high culture, establishing the roots of Indo-Persian culture in the
        region. From the region of modern-day Pakistan, key cities during the Mughal rule were Lahore and Thatta, both of
        which were chosen as the site of impressive Mughal buildings. In the early 16th century, the region remained under
        the Mughal Empire ruled by Muslim emperors. By the early 18th century, increasing European influence contributed to
        the slow disintegration of the Mughal Empire as the lines between commercial and political dominance became
        increasingly blurred. During this time, the English East India Company had established coastal outposts.[78] Control
        over the seas, greater resources, technology, and British military protection led the Company to increasingly flex
        its military muscle, allowing the Company to gain control over the subcontinent by 1765 and sideline European
        competitors.Expanding access beyond Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to
        annex or subdue most of region by the 1820s. Many historians see this as the start of the region's colonial
        period.[78] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself
        effectively made an arm of British administration, the Company began more deliberately to enter non-economic arenas
        such as education, social reform, and culture.[78] Such reforms included the enforcement of the English Education
        Act in 1835 and the introduction of the Indian Civil Service (ICS). Traditional madrasahs—primary institutions of
        higher learning for Muslims in the subcontinent—were no longer supported by the English Crown, and nearly all of the
        madrasahs lost their financial endowment.</p>
    <h2 id="last_para">Pakistan Movement</h2>
    <p>However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments for a united Islamic bloc called Islamistan were not shared by other
        Muslim governments,[166] although Islamists such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and
        leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, became drawn to the country. Pakistan's desire for an international organization
        of Muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) was formed. The
        strongest opposition to the Islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the Bengali Muslims
        of East Pakistan whose educated class, according to a survey by social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed, preferred
        secularism and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated West Pakistanis who tended to prefer an Islamic identity.
        The Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami considered Pakistan to be an Islamic state and believed Bengali nationalism to be
        unacceptable. In the 1971 conflict over East Pakistan, the Jamaat-e-Islami fought the Bengali nationalists on the
        Pakistan Army's side.</p>
