    <h2>Pakistan Movement</h2>
    <p>However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments for a united Islamic bloc called Islamistan were not shared by other
        Muslim governments, although Islamists such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of
        the Muslim Brotherhood, became drawn to the country. Pakistan's desire for an international organization of Muslim
        countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) was formed. The strongest
        opposition to the Islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the Bengali Muslims of East
        Pakistan[168] whose educated class, according to a survey by social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed, preferred
        secularism and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated West Pakistanis who tended to prefer an Islamic identity.
        The Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami considered Pakistan to be an Islamic state and believed Bengali nationalism to be
        unacceptable. In the 1971 conflict over East Pakistan, the Jamaat-e-Islami fought the Bengali nationalists on the
        Pakistan Army's side.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was the site of several ancient cultures and intertwined with the history
        of the broader Indian subcontinent. The ancient history involves the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age
        Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures,
        including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by numerous
        empires and dynasties, including the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander III of Macedon's empire, the Seleucid
        Empire, the Indian Maurya Empire, the Kushan Empire, the Gupta Empire, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Ghaznavids
        Empire, the Ghurid Sultanate, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Sur Empire, the Afghan
        Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire (partially) and, most recently, the British Indian Empire.</p>
