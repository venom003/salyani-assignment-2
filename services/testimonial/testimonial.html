    <h2>About Pakistan</h2>
    <p>Pakistan,[c] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a country in South Asia. It is the world's
        fifth-most populous country with a population exceeding 212.2 million. It has the world's second-largest Muslim
        population. It is the 33rd-largest country by area, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles).
        Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south and is
        bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is
        separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the northwest, and also shares a maritime
        border with Oman.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The territory that now constitutes Pakistan was the site of several ancient cultures and intertwined with the
        history of the broader Indian subcontinent. The ancient history involves the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh and the
        Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and
        cultures, including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. The area has been ruled by
        numerous empires and dynasties, including the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander III of Macedon's empire, the
        Seleucid Empire, the Indian Maurya Empire, the Kushan Empire, the Gupta Empire, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the
        Ghaznavids Empire, the Ghurid Sultanate, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Sur
        Empire, the Afghan Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire (partially) and, most recently, the British Indian Empire.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The Arab conqueror Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh in 711 CE. The Pakistan government's official chronology
        claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid but the concept of Pakistan came in 19th
        century. The Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region. During this
        period, Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu
        population to Islam.[74] These developments set the stage for the rule of several successive Muslim empires in
        the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526
        CE). The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE).</p>
